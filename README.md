# About this repository
This a continuation of learning the nightwatch testing framework

## Findings
Was able to configure the selenium server to run concurrent sessions
on four major web browsers simultaneously. Stumbled on trying to implement
test coverage on ie and microsoft edge because of my hardware. Moving
forward I want to learn code ship and how continuous integration helps
to solve this issue.

For now running these sessions allows for the ability for developers
to locally test multiple browsers given the proper hardware and web drivers.
